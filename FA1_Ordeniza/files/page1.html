						<li>The series is about the love and growth of young mages as they overcome their twisted fates due to a forbidden magic spell known as the "alchemy of souls", which allows souls to switch bodies.</li>
						<li>The main character is a powerful sorceress in a blind woman's body encounters a man from a prestigious family, who wants her help to change his destiny.</li>
						<li>My favorite character would be Master Lee. No one else was able to achieve his power throughout the series, so he is undoubtedly the strongest mage in “Alchemy of Souls“.</li>
